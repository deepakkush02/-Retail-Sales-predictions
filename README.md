> # Yes Bank Stock Closing Price Prediction
### Problem Statement
Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied. You are provided with historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann Stores, The task is to forecast the "Sales" column for the test set. Note that some Stores in the dataset were temporarily closed for refurbishment.

### Summary
Data from Rossman Stores has been provided to us, and it contains several variables that have an impact on the stores' sales. We'll talk about the project overview here.
After outlining our problem statement, we started by gathering our data, which included loading datasets from importing libraries, checking for duplicate values (neither dataset contained any), and checking for null values (there were none in the Store dataset but there were some in the Rossman dataset). Then, we learned how to interpret our variables, which also included their descriptions and unique values. Then, we moved on to Data Wrangling, which involves handling null values with the aid of looking for outliers. Second, two datasets were combined. After that, we typecast.

At that point, we did information visualization to get the relationship between the variables.
