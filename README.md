> #  Retail Sales Predictions
### Problem Statement
Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Rossmann store managers are currently tasked with predicting their daily sales up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied. You are provided with historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann Stores, The task is to forecast the "Sales" column for the test set. Note that some Stores in the dataset were temporarily closed for refurbishment.
> ### Summary
   Data from Rossman Stores has been provided to us, and it contains several variables that have an impact on the stores' sales. We'll talk about the project overview here.
   After outlining our problem statement, we started by gathering our data, which included loading datasets from importing libraries, checking for duplicate values (neither dataset contained any), and checking 
   for null values (none in the Store dataset but some in the Rossman dataset). Then, we learned how to interpret our variables, which also included their descriptions and unique values. Then, we moved on to Data 
   Wrangling, which involves handling null values by looking for outliers. Second, two datasets were combined. After that, we typecast.
